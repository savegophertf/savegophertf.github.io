                <p>25% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the men’s track team. That’s 25% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams. Athletically, in the past six years, the members of the men’s team have set 15 school
                    records, 110 top-10 program marks, and won too many indoor and outdoor individual Ivy League titles to count. They have had multiple second team All-Americans and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and
                    Craig Kinsley ‘12.

                    Brown's vision is to advance the ideal of the scholar-athlete-- "the bright and passionate student who embraces excellence both in academics and also in their sport." <i>-The Excellence in Brown Athletics Initiative press
                        release.</i>
                    <br></br>
                    The paragon of Brown's student athlete vision is someone who is recognized with an Academic All-Ivy award... Since 2009, Brown Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country athletes have won more Academic All-Ivy awards than anyone else
                    on campus, except for their female teammates.
                    <br></br>
                    Note: Track and Field/XC athletes compete in two or all three seasons throughout the year. These athletes truly embrace excellence in academics and sport simultaneously - many are "in season" during nearly every day of their
                    academic careers at Brown.

                    In 2019 across the Ivy League, Men’s Indoor and Outdoor track had the 3rd and 4th highest percentage of black athletes per team (after Basketball and Football). In 2019, the two sports were 16% black and almost 50% non-white,
                    making them two of the most racially diverse sports in the Ivy League.

                    Men’s Track and Field/Cross Country likely have the second highest number of black athletes at Brown after football. Brown does not report racial data on its student athletes, so these diversity statistics are estimates based on
                    Brown's reported team sizes and NCAA data on overall Ivy League demographics for 2019, and numbers in the figure may vary by 1-2 people due to rounding. Getting rid of the men’s track team would likely eliminate about 25% of the
                    black male athletes at Brown with no guarantee that other programs will overcome this loss (see caveats above, these are estimates).

                <p>
                    Brown's spending per individual athlete stands out as the lowest of any Men's Varsity sports. In fact, the Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country programs represent the lowest operating cost per individual athlete across the
                    entire
                    Ivy League (for both men's and women's sports). Between Cross Country, Indoor
                    Track, and Outdoor track, there are 108 combined roster spots, though there are only 47 unique athletes (conservative estimate). Whether the per-capita cost is calculated using roster spots or individual athletes, the combined
                    teams remain the least expensive
                    to
                    maintain. <i>Figure credit: Calvin Munson</i>

                    At the program level, Track and Field/Cross Country rank 11th most expensive of 15 sports, with a total operating cost of $306,500. Brown also spends the least money on Track and Field/XC of any of the other Ivies. For comparison,
                    the next least expensive Ivy League track program is Dartmouth, which spends $515,800 on
                    their track team. In addition, it is unclear just how much money cutting Men’s track will truly save, given that the Women’s team remains: The two teams share the vast majority of their resources (facilities, coaches, etc.), so
                    only a
                    portion of the Men’s operating cost may actually be removed.

                <p>
                    Among youth sports, track and field stands out as the least expensive sport to participate in at the pre-collegiate level, based on a 2019 survey by the Aspen Institute/Utah State University. <b>The same survey found that
                        low-income children are six times more likely to quit sports due to costs compared to their high-income peers. </b> This suggests that track and field, as an extremely cost-accessible sport for youth athletes, can represent a
                    source of socioeconomic diversity for athletics at the university level.
