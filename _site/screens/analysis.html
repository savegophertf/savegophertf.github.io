        <h2>#FALSESTART TO EXCELLENCE</h2>
        <p>25% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the men’s track team. That’s 25% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams. Athletically, in the past six years, the members of the men’s team have set 15 school records, 110
            top-10 program marks, and won too many indoor and outdoor individual Ivy League titles to count. They have had multiple second team All-Americans and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and Craig Kinsley ‘12.

            Brown's vision is to advance the ideal of the scholar-athlete-- "the bright and passionate student who embraces excellence both in academics and also in their sport." <i>-The Excellence in Brown Athletics Initiative press release.</i>
            <br></br>
            The paragon of Brown's student athlete vision is someone who is recognized with an Academic All-Ivy award... Since 2009, Brown Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country athletes have won more Academic All-Ivy awards than anyone else on
            campus, except for their female teammates.
            <br></br>
            Note: Track and Field/XC athletes compete in two or all three seasons throughout the year. These athletes truly embrace excellence in academics and sport simultaneously - many are "in season" during nearly every day of their academic
            careers at Brown.

        <p>
            Across the Ivy League in 2019, Men’s Indoor and Outdoor track had the 3rd and 4th highest percentage of black athletes per team (after Basketball and Football). In 2019, the two sports were 16% black and almost 50% non-white, making them
            two of the most racially diverse sports in the Ivy League. Unfortunately, the NCAA database only reports Race/Ethnicity categories as "White", "Black", and "Other" when searching by conference.

            The same patterns hold across the NCAA as a whole; in 2019, Men’s Indoor and Outdoor Track and Cross Country ranked behind only Basketball and Football as having the highest percentage of black athletes per team.

            Men’s Track and Field/Cross Country likely have the second highest number of black athletes at Brown after football. Brown does not report racial data on its student athletes, so these diversity statistics are estimates based on Brown's
            reported team sizes* and NCAA data on overall Ivy League demographics for 2019, and numbers in the figure may vary by 1-2 people due to rounding. Getting rid of the men’s track team would likely eliminate about 25% of the black male
            athletes at Brown with no guarantee that other programs will overcome this loss (see caveats above, these are estimates).

            In general, the Ivy League lags behind the NCAA as a whole when it comes to the participation of Black student-athletes: The NCAA has over 2.5x the proportion of Black athletes compared to the Ivy League (26.5% vs 10.2%). This low
            percentage is explained by the percentage of Black students in the Ivy League's general student body (also around 10%), however this highlights that the League should aim to increase its student-athlete diversity, rather than take actions
            that diminish it.

        <h2>#FALSESTART TO FINANCIAL EFFICACY</h2>
        <p>
            Brown's spending per individual athlete stands out as the lowest of any Men's Varsity sports. In fact, the Men’s Track and Field and Cross Country programs represent the lowest operating cost per individual athlete across the entire
            Ivy League (for both men's and women's sports). Between Cross Country, Indoor
            Track, and Outdoor track, there are 108 combined roster spots, though there are only 47 unique athletes (conservative estimate)*. Whether the per-capita cost is calculated using roster spots or individual athletes, the combined teams
            remain the least expensive
            to
            maintain. <i>Figure credit: Calvin Munson</i>

            At the program level, Track and Field/Cross Country rank 11th most expensive of 15 sports, with a total operating cost of $306,500. Brown also spends the least money on Track and Field/XC of any of the other Ivies. For comparison, the
            next least expensive Ivy League track program is Dartmouth, which spends $515,800 on
            their track team. In addition, it is unclear just how much money cutting Men’s track will truly save, given that the Women’s team remains: The two teams share the vast majority of their resources (facilities, coaches, etc.), so only a
            portion of the Men’s operating cost may actually be removed.

        <h2>#FALSESTART TO SOCIONOMIC ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
        <p>
            Among youth sports, track and field stands out as the least expensive sport to participate in at the pre-collegiate level, based on a 2019 survey by the Aspen Institute/Utah State University. <b>The same survey found that low-income
                children are six times more likely to quit sports due to costs compared to their high-income peers. </b> This suggests that track and field, as an extremely cost-accessible sport for youth athletes, can represent a source of
            socioeconomic diversity for athletics at the university level.

        <h2>Notes on the data</h2>
        <p>
            A note on the #FALSESTART to Excellence graphs: The awards are awarded separately for each season (Cross Country, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track), though they are summed in the graphs. We will display exact numbers for each season soon, in
            addition to these aggregated totals. In reality, when Brown cuts the combined programs, they cut the displayed award potential, since the three teams operate as one.
            <br></br>
            <b>*</b> A note on roster spots: Brown University's 2019 Equity in Athletics report displays that Cross Country takes up 17 spots, Indoor takes up 47 spots, and Outdoor takes up 44 spots. When calculating costs, the University sums up the
            total roster spots to 108 and reports the three teams as one combined "Track and Field/Cross Country". In reality, there are not 108 unique athletes on the combined teams - the Cross Country runners also compete in the distance events
            during Indoor/Outdoor, and the other event groups compete during both the Indoor and Outdoor seasons. When we use a number of <i>unique athletes</i> for calculations, such as when estimating the number of black athletes at per team or
            when calculating spending per unique athlete, we assume that among all three seasons, the Men's teams had a conservative estimate of 47 unique athletes (the most in any one season; Indoor). There are likely more than 47 unique athletes,
            however, since athletes often miss one or more seasons due to injury, and there are events that only compete during Outdoor (javelin).
            <br></br>
