        <p>
            As a queer cross-country and track and field athlete, I know what it feels like to experience adversity in many different forms. This adversity has shaped me to be the person that I am today, and I would not change my experiences in my
            life. I worked hard for many years to become a great runner in order to:
        <ol>
            <li>Be good at something that generates respect and ends the hardship of bullying and social exclusion</li>
            <li>Move to a place where I could experience queer life/culture as well as pursue my athletic and academic dreams, and</li>
            <li>Compete and actively represent the University of Minnesota in the best way possible as this track program gave me an amazing opportunity to fulfill my dreams</li>
        </ol>
        Coming to Minnesota I was committed to becoming the best runner possible, but I also made my decision because I wanted to grow as an openly queer student-athlete as there are many facets to me besides being a runner. Running for Minnesota
        was the best decision I had ever made because, for once in my life, I felt as though I could live a life in which I was my complete, authentic self and I could grow as the person I wanted to become. I chose to come to this program because
        I knew I could excel at a high level athletically and academically without having to worry about whether people would accept me as a gay man.
        <br><br>Discontinuing menâ€™s track and field kills the program that gave me a home and the opportunity to
        grow into the proud openly gay student-athlete I am today. This decision denies many kids the opportunity to fulfill similar dreams and aspirations at a University where they do not have to worry or be ashamed of their sexual orientation
        or gender identity. If not for this program that provided a welcoming community to me, I would not have ever experienced the same love and support from my teammates and coaches and I would not have grown into the confident and proud
        openly gay student-athlete that I am today. "
