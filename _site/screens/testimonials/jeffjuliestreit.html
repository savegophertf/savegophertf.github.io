            Our son is a current, red shirt freshman Men's Track & Field athlete. He had scholarship offers from two other Big Ten schools that were significantly better than what he got from the U of M. However, being a Gopher was his dream and he
            worked exceedingly hard at Mounds View HS to achieve that goal, both athletically and academically.
            <br><br>
            Being a Division I athlete at the prestigious U of M has been, and will continue to be, the dream of many Minnesota HS boys. Track & Field is the 2nd most popular boys HS sport behind football, and participation has been trending
            consistently higher every year while football continues to decline. Track & Field continues to be the most inclusive, accessible sport and it would be devastating to lose the Men's program at the U.
            <br><br>
            Our son is also an excellent student enrolled in the Carlson School of Business. He is the 5th generation in a row to attend the U of M, going all the way back to his great, great grandmother in the early 1920s. The thought of him leaving
            the U to pursue a business degree and track career somewhere else is hard for both him and us to fathom. Saving the Men's Track & Field program is the right thing to do!
