            My senior year, I had a season-ending injury which resulted in my recruitment’s being tough. However, the previous sprints and hurdles coach was persistent in getting me to Brown and after all I had been through that year, I felt it was a
            sign that Brown was still interested. I was shown that Brown would always be there for me. That was a part of my decision to come to Brown, along with the student engagement and open curriculum.
            <br></br>
            Brown has helped me become both more independent and more willing to take risks. Now I like trying many more new things, and I am open to trying to understand where people come from and what their ways of life may be. Before Brown, I
            believed track was an individual sport. But now I know as individuals we make up a great team. Athletically, Brown has helped me excel in a sport that I love and helped me learn that every team can be a family. Because that’s exactly what
            Brown Track and Field is: men and women, one family.
            <br></br>
            Brown Track and Field has driven numerous accomplishments in Brown Athletics and in the Ivy League. We made up 20% of the senior student athlete awards, and that only makes up a tiny bit of our team. We have always made noise in Brown
            Athletics and the Ivy League. Our team is the largest men’s team on campus, and the third most diverse in terms of percentages. (In terms of absolute numbers, we may still have more People of Color on the team.) We also have a large
            number of low-income athletes that would not normally have access to an Ivy League education if it weren’t for track and field, myself included.
            <br></br>
            <b>Taking away Brown Track and Field greatly diminishes People of Color’s and low-income students’ numbers and access to Brown.</b> It lowers the socioeconomic diversity on campus.
            <br></br>
            Coming out with a new initiative in the name of “excellence” and competitiveness at Brown without track and field is Christina Paxson’s and Jack Hayes’ first step in destroying Brown Athletics and lowering the access People of
            Color and
            low-income students have to attend the school. Making co-ed sailing and women’s sailing receive varsity status is their first attempt at lowering diversity and making sure only people from high income families can exclusively take
            over
            Brown Athletics.
