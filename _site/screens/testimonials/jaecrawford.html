        <p>
            I have thrown for nine years now, each year track and field provides me with loving teammates, compassionate coaches and something to invest my time and energy in. I was a pretty chubby kid for most of my life, so throwing was the only
            real avenue for me in the sport, but there was still a spot for me. Being pulled from the warmup lap the first day of tryouts in sixth grade is arguably the best moment of my life. I threw my first shot put that day and I joined my first
            throws squad. I can confidently claim that I would not be who I am or where I am without that group of people, without the sport of track and field and without throwing things retrieving them and throwing them again. The people I
            mentioned earlier were not all female, though I was a member of Horizon Middle School’s Girls Track Team, I joined a coed program. I have trained with boys and men for nine years and I do not plan to stop such a long lived tradition,
            especially not in the name of excellence. Brown University’s Excellence Initiative deprives hardworking and compassionate men from competing in a sport they have engaged in for much of their life. Yet the trauma does not stop there, track
            and field is an extremely accessible sport. For poor and chubby kids alike, track and field enables the growth of individuals regardless of one’s race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status. Track and Field does
            not discriminate. Track and Field at Brown, specifically, offers an avenue for black men to infiltrate a predominantly white institution not made for them but made by them. The university, through this initiative is depriving itself of a
            cohort of men unlike any other. Yet the trauma does not stop there, with the cutting of the men’s cross country and track and field teams Brown will be forced to fire two of our current coaches, NCAA rules. That means two female event
            groups will be without a coach in the Fall. Meaning two female event groups will experience a negligence they did not sign up for. Two female event groups will no longer be able to recruit competitive athletes, no one would commit to a
            program lacking their event coach. Yet the trauma does not stop there, with the sudden nature of the university’s decision current athletes have very limited options. These men have recently declared their concentrations, have signed
            leases and have cultivated a life at Brown. This life revolves around their involvement in varsity track and field and cross country. These men are being told that if they are upset they should consider transferring, in layman's terms, if
            you disagree with our decision give up your ivy league education and degree, or stop making such a fuss and give up the sport ingrained in your identity. Yet the trauma does not stop there, the university was not concerned with the high
            school seniors who denied athletic scholarships to joined Brown cross country and track and field. These boys lost their senior year, lost their recruiting spots at other universities and they lost the teams they committed to. We all
            committed to a university overtly not committed to us. I am devastated and angry but most of all I am prepared to defend my teammates, my training partners and my family until this university realizes you cannot declare something
            excellent when it denies those who are excellent of their very identity.
