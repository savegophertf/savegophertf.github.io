            One of the big reasons that I decided to apply to Brown was because my high school track coach, a person I greatly admired, was also a Brown Track & Field alumna. As an admittedly mediocre sprinter, I never contributed to the team score,
            but I was welcomed by the team and never made to feel like I didn’t belong. I stayed on the team for all four years and it was an important part of my experience at Brown. As a sprinter, college represented my last opportunity to compete
            in a sport I loved. I grew as a person, learning to push myself physically well beyond anything I had thought possible. More important, however, were my friendships with my fellow teammates, many of whom came from backgrounds very
            different from my own. These daily interactions with such a diverse group of wonderful men and women helped me broaden my perspective. I have often felt this was one of the most important lessons I learned at Brown. As a high school track
            coach, I have continued to remain involved in the sport so that others may continue to reap the same benefits.
            <br></br>
            Thus, it was with shock that I read that the Men’s Team has been cut in the name of promoting diversity and excellence. It is hard to understand how cutting one of the most diverse teams at Brown promotes diversity. Track, as a sport,
            also has one of the lowest barriers to entry. Anyone can run, jump, or throw. Getting rid of a team that in its very make-up represents the diversity and excellence that Brown’s new initiative claims to support also goes against
            everything that I thought Brown stood for.
