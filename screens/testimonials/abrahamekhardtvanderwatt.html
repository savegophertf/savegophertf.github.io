            Being an international athlete this track team had given me a family. It has given me people to push me and help me to become nog just a better athlete but to become a self dependent and positive person who goes out in this world to be
            the positive in a negative world. All good things must come to an end, I agree but to rip a way the possibility for other athletes that is in the same boat as me looking for a family to help them become the person they are ment to be is
            just hart breaking. If you ho look at the people on the team and 95% of them will tell you that this team this FAMILY has made them who they are today.
