            Collegiate Running is more than just physiological development, it’s about honing in skills on resilience, patience, and teamwork. If I didn’t attend the University of Minnesota, I wouldn’t know what it means to be part of a team that
            cares about not just an athletes current well being, but building their potential for success for life.

            Cutting the program would send waves throughout the nation, setting a precedent to other institutions that it’s okay to let go of a team like ours. The devastating effect would be the loss in opportunity for many students. In my
            experience, every student who graduates from the track team has left with a greater respect for their peers, a greater appreciation for hard work, and a greater understanding how opportunities can change lives.
