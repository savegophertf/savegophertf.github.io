            Without my teammates, male and female, my personal accomplishments as a Brown University track and cross country athlete never would have been possible. I credit so many of my teammates with the support, dedication, and inspiration that I
            relied on to train consistently and compete passionately.Track is not an individual sport and it is not a gendered sport. There is no Brown women’s track program without the Brown men’s track program and, for me, there is no Brown
            University without Brown University cross country and track and field.
