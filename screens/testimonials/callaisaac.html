            Brown has one track and field team, this team contains both men and women. We are not and never have been separate teams. I loved every second I spent with my family, and I wouldn’t trade my experience for the world. Ignoring the
            impact this decision has on current athletes - negatively affecting athletics, academics, and overall experience, while abruptly destroying any pride felt for the program - this will be detrimental to the quality of the athletic
            program at Brown. It will reduce the number of successful athletes and make already challenging recruiting even more difficult.
