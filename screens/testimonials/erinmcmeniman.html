            The other schools I was considering were of the same academic caliber as Brown so the decision essentially came down to track and field. Brown’s team felt the most like a family and having Coach Craig, an Olympian in my event, arguably
            the best collegiate javelin coach in the country coach me, I couldn’t say no. The diversity across the two teams brings a culture that Brown prides itself on, and by eliminating the men’s team it feels as if Brown is taking a step back
            from who we are and what we believe in as a university.
