            As an incoming freshman, I decided to go to Brown because of its values and commitment to students and athletics. I loved the supportive team atmosphere of the track team. Although women’s track remains, it will be anything but
            unaffected. With the possibility of loosing coaches and an entire support system gone, I will not be able to achieve the excellence that Brown promised me when I committed only a month ago. I believe that the faculty at Brown is
            trying to make a better setting for its students. But cutting a 145-year old beloved program is not the way to do it.
