            Being a member of the track and field team has been the best part of my Brown experience. My teammates (both male and female) are my best friends and family, and I never would have considered attending Brown if the University did not have
            a men’s program. It is frustrating on so many levels that Brown has cut one of it’s most diverse programs without any transparency especially given the recent racial injustices that have occurred in this country.
