            So much of my experience as a man and man of color was cultivated during my days on College Hill. Being a student-athlete was tough but being a minority made it even more challenging. The track experience helped bring us together and no
            matter where you were from, regardless of the color of your skin, when the gun went off and then the sand was measured, all that mattered was who won the event and who cheered Bruno at the end! Thatâ€™s the joy and beauty of sports. To
            unite, not to divide. To embrace our differences. To inspire unity. To encourage greatness. To Be More Today than we were yesterday. My entire book is about my experiences on the track. My heart goes out to all of the current men on the
            roster and incoming freshmen who, like me, had faith in the core values Brown is supposed to stand for.
