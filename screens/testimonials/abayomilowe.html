            As a current member of the track and field program I’ve learned to practice discipline, perseverance, and dedication inside and outside of the classroom. Without the guidance of the upperclassmen on the team who have shown me what
            it truly means to be excellent in all areas of life, I don’t know where I would have found the support to succeed in my first academic year at Brown.
