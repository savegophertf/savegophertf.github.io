            Track and field is the original sport in human history, the most egalitarian sport, the most diverse sport and the purest sport. The sports world is trending towards health and fitness, there is no better measure than track and field.
            <br></br>
            Other colleges have cut track and field, but those were not successful programs like the one in Minnesota, so it is shocking that anyone would even think of cutting this program. There are more track and field athletes in Minnesota high
            schools than any other sport, counting both boys and girls teams, which shows the university does not even know its own state.

            My son wants to run at a Division I school but must now go out of state to do it. Nobody wants that, it literally sends our best athletes out of the state.
            <br></br>
            The pantheon of sports starts with track and field, and everything else is just a game.
