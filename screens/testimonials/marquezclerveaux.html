            Track has had a very large impact on my life. Without it I would not be here today. I honestly have no idea where I would be if not here right now. One thing I know is without track I wouldnâ€™t be getting the quality Of education I am
            today. Another thing I would miss out on is all the bonds and friendships I have made here. Cutting the track team would mean the end of an opportunity for many different kinds of people. On the track team we have many athletes from other
            countries. This would put an end to that. Track and field is a sport that includes people from all over with different abilities. Many athletes from other sports also did track in high school. It would be tragic to rip away the dreams of
            current and future athletes of this school. A disservice from our athletic department.
