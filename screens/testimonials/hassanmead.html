        <p>
            I grown up South Minneapolis about 4 blocks from where the Gopher Football team’s TCF Bank Stadium is built now. As neighbor to the U of Minnesota I have first hand seen how the community grew in the last two
            decades in both infrastructure and community leaders.
            <br><br>
            Long before I knew I was in heart of the community as I attend at the U of Minnesota for full athletic scholarship to represent the Golden Gophers in Cross Country, indoor and Outdoor track and field. This opportunity lead to 9 time Big10
            individual titles , 8 time All-American and 6 time Big10 Team title. All accolades aside, it’s very difficult to put measurement on the experience and community relationship that the University of Minnesota provided to me. This program
            allows young inner city like myself to see the world in a way that’s unmeasurable. All I want is the future generation to have access and chance like I had and the ones that came before.
            <br><br>
            I hope that you can find in your heart that it’s unjustifiable to terminate this program and void the U of Minnesota’s decision.
            <br><br>
            Thank you.
