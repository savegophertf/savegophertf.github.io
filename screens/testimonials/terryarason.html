            I have 3 children that compete in Track and Field. This sport has taught them so many life lessons. They have learned the value of hard work through daily practice, competing against others and also against themselves as they are striving
            for their next PR! They have learned the importance of working together as a team through the many different events and the importance of cheering on your fellow team mates when they are competing. They have not only learned how to handle
            yourself with grace when you have fallen but to pick yourself up, never give up and learn from your mistakes. My husband and I also competed in Track and Field, it has brought so much joy to our family. The special thing about this sport
            is that there is an event for everyone, no one is turned away and everyone is better for being a part of Track and Field. It makes available opportunities for those that may not have options to compete in other sports. It would be tragic
            if UM took away this opportunity for the many young men of Minnesota that dream of competing for the Gophers.
