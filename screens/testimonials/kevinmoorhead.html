            I went to the U to run for Coach Griak. I had yet to decide on a career path, but I knew that it had to include continuing my distance running. Coach Griak was a legend in my community, St. Louis Park as were the athletes he coached at
            Park High. Thanks to Coach, I am in my 44th year as a high school coach in Minnesota. Athletics, track and field played an integral part in the development of my career. Integrity was a key component in what Coach Griak preached. Let's
            hope the UM keeps its integrity and reinstates Men's Track & Field !
