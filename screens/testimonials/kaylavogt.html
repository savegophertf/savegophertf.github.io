            Cutting the men's track and field team would not only greatly impact the men's team, but the womenâ€™s as well. This would negatively impact the women's recruiting, coaching staff, and cross country rosters. This would be a tragedy to all
            gopher sports and have a ripple effect on all universities in the Big Ten. Ending 130 years of tradition would be devastating to not only our track team, but the entire University. The University states that they provide equality for all
            students, yet they want to cut one of the most diverse teams at the University. My fellow teammates have become a part of my family, welcoming me to the University of Minnesota. Please don't tear my family apart.
