            Track has been my life since 5th grade. I chose to run at Brown because of the excellent coaching, the ethos and competitiveness of the team, the challenging but supportive environment, and the family of athletes. No other school I found
            embodied those things more. I can’t believe, before I even step on campus, the administration has decided this community and all that it stands for — never mind the hard work and commitments their athletes have made — is in their eyes
            worthless. They’ve defiled their commitment to their students and have proven they don’t stand for diversity, competitiveness, and excellence. They only stand for themselves.
