            Track has changed my life for the better. I’ve gotten the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than myself, bigger than just running. The track program here at the University of Minnesota is such a tight knit community. We are a
            family, a family filled with the most diversity on the entire campus. The men’s and women’s teams have been combined since I came here my freshman year, and I can’t imagine it being any other way. The men are our teammates, we would not
            be complete without them. This proposal made by Mark Coyle and Joan Gabel is absolutely unacceptable. The University of Minnesota cannot think it is okay to cut an entire program, 130 years of excellence.
