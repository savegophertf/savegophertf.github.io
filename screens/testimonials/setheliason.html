            Track and cross country have been one of the most, if not the most impactful parts of my life. I have made memories and friendships that I will cherish forever and I don’t think any of this would have been possible without the track
            program. I’m devastated young Minnesotans won’t have the same opportunity I have. The team has brought so much opportunity to a wide variety of people here in Minnesota and across the country, taking it away from all of us is a violation
            of the history of this program.
