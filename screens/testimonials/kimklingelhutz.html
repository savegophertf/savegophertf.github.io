            I ran on the women's track team for just one year which was Gary Wilson's first year and he was encouraging walk-ons. I got to know Roy Griak and my first thought when I heard about the men's team being cut was, "what would Coach Griak
            think?" The comrardry between the men's and women's teams was awesome! After all the money spent on the track facilities, it seems like a real shame to let go of such a great program and the dreams of so many high school kids who have
            strived to achieve the chance to compete at the D1 level in maroon and gold.
