            When I walked-on to the Brown Track and Field team, I was 5,000 miles from home and 50 seconds slower than my teammates but I knew immediately that I had found my family. Without other athletes to look up to, especially successful men's
            team walk-ons, I would not have taken myself seriously nor, I suspect, graduate with nine top-10 program marks. I cannot overestimate the impact of Brown Track and Field on developing my self-possession and on shaping me into the kind of
            person my high school-self genuinely believed she could never be.
