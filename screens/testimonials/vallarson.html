            I never expected the men’s track and field team to make such a big impact on my life. As a current member of the women’s track and field team, I can say with 100% confidence that my collegiate experience would not have been nearly as
            fulfilling if it weren’t for the men’s team. The men and their coaches provide encouragement during practice and at meets, inspire everyone with their hard work and determination to improve everyday, and make being a Gopher
            student-athlete more fun than I could have ever imagined. Without the men’s team, the women’s team would drastically suffer. They would not be as motivated, as competitive, or as happy.
            <br></br>
            In addition to the negative impact removing men’s track and field would have on the women’s team, I can think of countless other reasons why this decision is unjustifiable. Cutting men’s track and field takes away opportunities.
            Opportunities for people of color to attend college. Opportunities for boys to compete for their home state at the highest collegiate level. Opportunities for the University of Minnesota to instill excellence and character in men through
            track and field. The historical success of this program and bright future is too grand to throw away.
