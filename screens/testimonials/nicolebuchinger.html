            This team brought me to the University of Minnesota, much like many of my fellow teammates. It has given me so many opportunities to not only develop as an athlete, but as a leader and teammate. My life would be completely different
            without all of the lessons being an athlete at this university has taught me.
            <br></br>
            Getting rid of this program would mean that people for generations to come would be stripped of the opportunity to run for the state they love. No longer would this team be able to shape athletes into successful leaders. This program is
            so much more than just running. This program is the reason why I am the strong person I am today, and it would be a shame to stop providing an environment for young adults to grow and learn.
