            During my time as a a track and field athlete Minnesota, I was surrounded by some amazing men as teammates. One of the things I was most proud of was being a part of a community that represented our state so well. Though we came from so
            many different backgrounds, we shared time and effort directed at a common goal. By experiencing community with such a diverse group of people, I learned to not take all that I had been given in my life for granted. Track and field
            engrained in me the value of sacrifice and the pride of working for something larger than myself. My teammates and the amazing community I was a part of made me a more empathetic person.
