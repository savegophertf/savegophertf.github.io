            For me, having the men’s team in addition to the women’s was a huge part of my decision to attend UMN. Without the men’s side to track and field, it would’ve made me feel as though women’s track was only there to fulfill Title IX
            requirements. As a recruit, the team dynamic would not have been as strong without the men’s team; with no men’s team, it would’ve felt as though UMN did not take track as seriously as other sports. Throughout my time at the U so far, the
            men’s team has been influential in my experience, whether that be through the support from captains who are men, the supportive environment the men provide at practice, or the academic teamwork with men’s team members.
