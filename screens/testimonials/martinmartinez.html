            "Truthfully, when I first received my Track and Field recruiting letter from Coach Springfield my junior year of high school I couldn’t locate Brown University on a map, let alone identify it as an Ivy League school. I come from poor teen
            parents — the Ivy League was something you heard mentioned on the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and that was it. It wasn’t somewhere a 𝑏𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑛 kid from Waukegan could end up.
            <br></br>
            In 2018, I graduated from Brown with a combined B.A./ Sc.B. degree, broke the Brown University Indoor mile record in a time of 3:59.34, and anchored our distance medley relay team to a 9th place finish at the NCAA National Meet. In the
            fall I will start law school at the University of Chicago. Track and Field made this possible. Track and Field provided a lane with hope for the “American Dream.”"
