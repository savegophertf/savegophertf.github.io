            "What does being a University of Minnesota Track and Field team member mean to me?

            I grew up in a small town in norther Minnesota, where I ran track and cross country throughout high school. I loved both sports and planned to make running a lifelong endeavor. I never really imagined myself competing as a Gopher. That
            seemed like something completely unattainable, and in my mind was really only a dream. I was very fortunate however; and through hard work and dedication I had a successful senior year in cross country and track, and was offered a
            scholarship late in the year from Coach Griak. I accepted and couldn’t wait to join the team.
            <br></br>
            I accepted the offer and went to the U for one reason and one reason only. I wanted to run track. XC too, but I looked at XC as a way to train for track. I was a middle distance runner and XC wasn’t my strength, but it made me better on
            the track, and ultimately I loved to run so I gave it my all in both sports.
            <br></br>
            The decision to go to the U completely changed my life for the better. I had some minor successes on the track, but what I gained off the track from being a part of the team and a great program was even greater and has stayed with me my
            entire life. There were so many experiences and wonderful memories we had as a team. We still talk about them every time we all get together, which we still do almost 30 years later. I met my best friend and many other life long friends
            who I know would be there for me if ever needed in a heart beat…true friends…brothers. I learned the importance of an education and went on to gain an MBA at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management. Finally, and most
            importantly, I started my professional career working at the UMN for seven years after college where I met my wife who I now have two amazing children with. None of this would have happened had it not been for the University of Minnesota
            Track and Field program.
            <br></br>
            I’m just one person, but the idea that this will no longer be an option for so many athletes around the world, but specifically to Minnesota athletes is devastating. I would not be the person I am today had it not been for the friends I
            made and the life lessons I learned running for the U of MN. My years there were some of my best. We need to keep this opportunity available for others.
            <br></br>
            So, let me answer the question that I started with. What does being a University of Minnesota track team member mean to me? It means everything. Everything I have today is inextricably linked to my being a Gopher Track and Field team
            member. Do not take that away from other young aspiring runners in Minnesota that want to be a Gopher too. "
