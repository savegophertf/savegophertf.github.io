            Track has paved the way for me in life for lots of new opportunities in life. I became motivated to do better in school because of track. I met some of my closest friends and peers in track and networked with people all across the world.
            It would be tragic for Minnesota to rip the program because it is an opportunity for student athletes like myself to accomplish our dreams at our dream school. Also sports can keep be an escape route for athletes coming from inferior
            backgrounds. Some athletes use track to provide and get a better life for themselves and there families.
