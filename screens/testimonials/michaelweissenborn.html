            I was a student-manager for six years. I almost dropped out of college. The track team kept me going. I'm now leading an awesome life, working happily as a software engineer for one of the largest data analytics firms in the world.
            <br><br>
            I'm not where I am today without this team. Gutting the program would destroy the dreams of so many student-athletes, and it won't stop here - universities across the country are waiting to see what happens at Minnesota. We must do
            everything possible to preserve opportunities for these kids.
