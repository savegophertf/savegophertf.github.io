            The men's track and field program has impacts far beyond sport. These men have been and continue to be some of the best representatives of the University of Minnesota, the state of Minnesota, and even the United States of America. The
            athletes that have been through this program have been valiant representatives, inspiring many others to follow in their footsteps, and they have done this at every competitive level. Their demonstrated discipline in sport, academics, and
            life has been critical for me in my own journey as a student-athlete at the University of Minnesota. From these men, I have learned how to pursue both athletic and academic excellence, I have learned about the support that men can offer
            to female leaders, I have leaned how to represent this university with pride. I, nor my fellow female teammates, would have many of the important experiences with these men that have shaped my learning over the last three years if the
            men's program did not exist.
