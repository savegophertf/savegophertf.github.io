            As a 4 year member and captain of the Brown Track and Field/XC I learned the discipline needed to excel in medical school and as a budding physician. My exposure to diversity at Brown, particularly through the Track and Field/XC team,
            catalyzed a desire and need to better understand the experiences of my diverse patient population so that I may better serve them as a physician.
