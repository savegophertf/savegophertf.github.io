            Brown Track & Field taught me the meaning of diversity, the value of perspective, and the importance of my commitments to others and to myself. On top of having unbelievably talented and diverse teammates and coaches guide me
            through those lessons, one of the most rewarding feelings was the pride I felt at graduation for fulfilling my commitment to the university. The fact that Brown decided to suddenly and unapologetically cancel their commitment to
            today's athletes weighs heavy on my heart.
