            I transferred to the University of Minnesota after my freshman year of college. I arrived to campus completely broken by my former team, both as a person and as a runner. I was absolutely terrified; terrified of being outcasted again,
            terrified of another injury, terrified that my love for running had been lost for good. Minnesota was my last chance to have the collegiate experience I had been dreaming of since I began running in middle school.
            <br></br>
            From day one, the track and field team embraced me with open arms. I realized right away that we are a brotherhood here; a tightly knit family, through and through. Almost immediately, my passion for running was reignited. I've made
            friendships on the team that are sure to last a lifetime. This program has changed my life in a way no other experience ever will. Cancelling the Minnesota track and field program means eradicating opportunities for countless young men to
            realize a dream, just as I did.
