            Gopher track and field and being a Gopher in general means everything to me. I spent my whole life wanting to be a Gopher, and was lucky enough to get that opportunity. One of the proudest moments in my life was putting on the M for the
            very first time.
            <br><br>
            Gopher track and field completely shaped who I am now, there were definitely lots of ups and downs through the experience but that is how I grew so much as a person and use that in my life every day. I currently teach at Forest Lake High
            School and am a head coach of Boys Cross Country, Boys Track and Field, and Girls Hockey. I spend every day working with the youth and instilling the values that I learned being a part of the Gopher track and field team. I can't imagine
            where I would be without all of my teammates and coaches and experiences I had during that time. Getting to be around such amazing young men from all different backgrounds is an experience I would not of had without Gopher track and field
            and I would not be the man I am today without these experiences.
            <br><br>
            Being a Gopher is a part of my identity and something I hold onto very closely. The news of losing this connection to the university is heartbreaking to me. I love everything about being a Gopher and forever feel so proud to be a part of
            such an incredible institution. Please do not take this away from the current and future young men that might get the chance to be a part of Gopher track and field.
