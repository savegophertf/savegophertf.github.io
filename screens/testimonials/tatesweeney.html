            I know I am not alone when I said I dreamed of being a Gopher since I was little. It was a dream to compete at the highest level collegiately and to be at an academically rigorous University like Minnesota’s. Now being here, I realized
            that my dream was one sided, I didn’t understand that to be on the Gopher tf team meant that I would get a second family. The decision to remove the tf team has left us heartbroken but we are not giving up without a fight, we’re willing
            to do whatever it takes to protect our family. For the sake of the past, present and future Gophers, help us save our program.
