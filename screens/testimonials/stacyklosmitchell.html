            Track gave me a chance at a great college experience and transformed me to a confident, competent and prepared woman. The teammates I had enhanced my life immensely and still do! I knew as soon as I stepped on campus I wanted to be a

            The tragedy is the fact that opportunity is lost for many athletes in sports that already take a backseat in popularity but lead in academics and integrity. The U will be missing out on some of the best student athletes and will not be
            trusted again to make a valid decision.
