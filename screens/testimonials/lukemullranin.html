            I was a walk-on from northern Minnesota who had his dreams come true at the U! My time on the track team taught me life lessons, gave me the opportunity to befriend talented people from different backgrounds, and provided me an
            opportunity to win! From walk on to Big Ten champion, my time on the team means more than most can understand. Please donâ€™t take that opportunity away from future Gophers.
