            I have seen my son, a rising senior on the XC and track teams, run over 10 miles a day, rain or shine, since returning home due to the COVID school closure 2.5 months ago. He runs alone, but his greatest motivation is the thought
            of running with his teammates again with the “B” on his chest. While these guys are far too dedicated to give up on their passion now, what a shame that their biggest challenge did not come from competition or injury but from
            their own school, the one to which they devoted their hearts, minds, and bodies.
