            In 2017 Gopher Track and Field was the light I needed to get out of a dark place. I was mentally drained and had capped out my potential as a student and an athlete at a different University. Having bigger goals for my future, I will
            forever be grateful to the University Of Minnesota for seeing the potential in me and recruiting me to be on the team by 2018. I would not be where I am today without my experience with Gopher Track and Field.
