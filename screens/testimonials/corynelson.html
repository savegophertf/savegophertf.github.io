            My son Zach Nelson is a senior on the men’s track team. He was a late bloomer on the track scene, starting with his senior year in high school, where he made the Minnesota state meet in the 100 and 200. Having already decided on going to
            Hamline, he was contacted by Paul Thornton about a month before his freshman year was going to start. He made the decision to join the program at the U, and it’s been a fantastic experience. Without this opportunity, he would not have
            attended the U (and paid full tuition for all four years). The friendships he has developed will be long lasting, and the ability to compete at the highest level has been so rewarding. I sincerely hope that the regents and athletic
            department will reconsider this decision.
