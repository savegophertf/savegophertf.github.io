            This program has brought me to my closest friends and exposed me to a diverse group of people who I get to learn and grow with every day. Its value extends beyond the 58 individuals on the team. It is something to look to for high
            schoolers aspiring to represent their state at the highest level. It is an opportunity for people of color and underprivileged young men to attend college. It is the crown jewel of the extensive community that makes up Minnesota running.
            To end this program would be a disservice to its current athletes, its alumni, high school runners, and the thousands of people who feel its effects every day.
