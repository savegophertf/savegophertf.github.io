            An invaluable take away from being a part of a team is the reinforcement of the belief that we are stronger together than we are individually. As a member of Brown’s Track & Field team (both men and women), we train together, strain
            together, fight through injuries together, all to compete at our best to proudly represent Brown University with distinction. Cutting or demoting our men’s program is a great loss to a support system that has become family.

            As a woman of color attending a University striving to diversify, it is challenging to gain acceptance and to make genuine connections. The diversified team that is Brown Track & Field provides me with folks who share my interest and are
            prepared to work towards a common goal. The unity, that is perhaps lacking in our national discourse, is present within the Track & Field program. This alone is reason enough to keep both the men and women’s program together.
