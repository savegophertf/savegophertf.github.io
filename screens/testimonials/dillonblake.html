            I chose the University of Minnesota because not only was it a place where I could get a great education and live in a beautiful city, but it was a place where I could learn about people from different backgrounds and cultures. The
            university valued providing opportunities to many different people so they could both learn in class and learn from each other.

            A great example of the diversity of the school is the Track and Field team. I knew that by joining this
            program I would not only grow in my sport but also grow as a person. The track is an oval classroom where lessons that can't be taught in a traditional educational setting are learned. I grew to love this university for what it stood for,
            but when out of nowhere we were informed that they intended to cut the Menâ€™s Track and Field program, I was heartbroken. What happened to the school I loved that valued the importance of diversity and learning beyond the classroom?
