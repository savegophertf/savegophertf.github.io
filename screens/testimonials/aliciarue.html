            As a high school senior I toured only 2 universities, and made a last minute decision change to go to the U of M because I felt more connected to the area and the coaches. Throughout my 4 years of competition I appreciated being close to
            home where friends and family could support me. Although I completed on the women’s team, this story is the same for many men on the current team and on future teams.
            <br></br>
            College men’s track and field is an opportunity for students to attend the U of M who would otherwise not have ( due to sport, cost, location, etc). Collegiate track and field is a community and a family. Most of my current friends 10
            years later are my past teammates. This is where I learned to care about the success of others, truly help and sacrifice for a team, and the obvious work ethic and time management.
            <br></br>
            Lastly, don’t tell me this is a choice based on budget and title nine. Both men’s and women’s track and field numbers could fluctuate easily. Give the coaches a chance to add athletes as needed. Track and field is also not a high budget
            sport. Coaches are paid very little in comparison to other sports, and equipment is minimal. There are many bigger funded places where budget could be cut or changed.
