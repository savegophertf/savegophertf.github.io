            My dad passed away from cancer my Freshman year at the U of MN and Roy Griakâ€™s roll in my life expanded from Coach to surrogate father and mentor. The team support and comradeship uplifted me. We were a big family with an annual reunion
            at the Snotty Nose fund raiser. Athletics and the life lessons I learned in competition have been lifelong companions. Future Track and Field athletes should be afforded the same opportunities.
