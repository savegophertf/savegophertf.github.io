            Working in the Big Ten conference for seven years on opposing staff’s I was always very aware of the pride in which the Minnesota men’s track team carried itself. That team always seemed to compete for its State, compete for its history,
            compete hard and with a pride that was apparent. To discontinue this program after a century-plus of representing the university and state of Minnesota at the highest levels, at the Olympic levels, is unfathomable to me. The Alums
            associated with this team deserve better, the program deserves respect. And that’s coming from an opposing coach for the better part of the last decade. There’s no group of young men that will continue to better represent the values of
            the University of Minnesota. I’ve seen it. It’s time for those from within the University to see it as well.
