            At the beginning of my senior year on Brown Women's Cross Country, our beloved coach unexpectedly left. In an overlooked act of kindness, the men's team took us in without hesitation. The few barriers that had separated us as two teams
            dissolved, and we became one- one coach, one practice time, one team. Thanks to the graciousness of the men's team, what had felt like the end of our program was really just the beginning.
            <br></br>
            The values demonstrated here are indicative of the kind of men this team attracts. Compassionate, driven, diverse- both in academic interests and upbringing- men that go out into the world to uphold Brown University's greater mission of
            serving the community.
