            I am currently a pediatric neurologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and I attribute much of my drive, passion, and hard work to serve my community and to take care of children from all parts of the world to the wonderful
            experience I had at Brown University.
            <br></br>
            As an African American high school student in a predominantly Caucasian public school, I worked tirelessly academically and athletically to break the barriers of what I was “expected to be” and how I was “expected to perform”. I fell in
            love with an immediate sense of community, passion, determination, and inclusion that I felt amongst the track and field team. I immediately knew this was the place for me. I was offered a full scholarship at Syracuse University and
            although my family could not afford for me to go to Brown University, they believed in me and they knew I would make the best of my time at Brown.
            <br></br>
            <b>Brown cross-country and track and field taught me about true diversity and inclusion, as this team of individuals is by far the most diverse athletic team on Brown’s campus.</b> It is diverse racially, culturally, economically,
            socially,
            athletically and academically. If it were not for my experience on this incredible team, I would not be the man, runner, or physician I am today.
            <br></br>
            I wake up at 4:30 am on most mornings to run before my (sometimes 30 hour) shifts in the hospital. With the same hard work and determination I learned from my time with Brown Track and Field I ran a 2:18 full marathon and qualified for
            the 2020 US Marathon Olympic Trials this past February in Atlanta, Georgia. I was able to compete in this historic event alongside multiple other Brown Track and Field alumni.
            <br></br>
            It saddens me to know that you have decided to eliminate this cherished athletic program as you will be preventing future young men like myself from getting to live out their dreams to excel at the highest levels both athletically and
            academically. Your decision is not only heartbreaking for me but will be completely devastating for the future of Brown University as a whole moving forward.
