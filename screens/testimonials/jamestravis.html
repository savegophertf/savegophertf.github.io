            After spending 5 years as a part of the Men's Track and Field team I can comfortably say that the most important aspect of the program is the relationships that are developed. I could talk about the opportunity to compete and staying
            active on campus and on and on, but the things that have stuck with me and have meant the most are the relationships I have made. The men I shared a locker room with, I would consider family. Relationships that were formative in who I am
            today in an extremely impactful group of years in my life. Between amazing and respectful coaches and teammates who are all pushing you to be a better athlete as well as a better person it was impossible to go through this program without
            coming out the other side a better man because of it. What I learned from these relationships are more important to me than anything learned in the classroom.
