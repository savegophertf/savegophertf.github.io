            Track has made me the person I am & I get to learn from different people, sexually ordertions, cultures that never would have known about. It all family to me cause I have made family members that I have kept in touch with for 10 or
            more years & even one guy that was my assistant in high school all the way through college I coached with him at the college raced at, we have know each other for 25 years of friendship.
            <br><br>
            It would be a tragedy to get rid of track &
            field cause you have wide diversity of people & cultures on the team that you learn from & get along with. Also in these times of that we are living in today with the social injustice. You are also not given the future generations a
            chance to do this sport. This sport is my heart & soul of me & with out I donâ€™t think I would be where I would be I would either be 300 lbs or dead.
