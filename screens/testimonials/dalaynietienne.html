            The track brings people together from all walks of life. It gives people a family full of diversity and pride. Stripping this family from the University of Minnesota is going against everything the University stands for, including
            inclusivity, diversity, and equal opportunity.

            Of course, this will have a negative impact on the athletes, but the coaches as well. This will leave many people out of jobs and most of these people are people of color. Cutting the Men’s Track and Field program is taking away people’s
            opportunities for generations to come. The absence of this outstanding program will completely wipe out not only opportunities but the dreams of the current and future gophers who fantasized about being a part of this family their whole
            life. Please help us save this program because it is much more than a just a BIG10 Track and Field team, it is our family.
