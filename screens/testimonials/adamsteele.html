            Being a member of the Gopher Track and Field was nothing short of life-changing. I consider my teammates, coaches, and support staff to be family. So much so, our son is named after my coach, Phil.
            <br></br>
            What happened on the track was dedication, victories, losses.
            <br></br>
            What happened off the track was character building, friendships, acceptance, and vulnerability.
            <br></br>
            What I learned from being a Gopher, was that it wasn't just about the outcome. It was every step along the way. To celebrate the process and the ever-changing seasons. The co-existence of one person having a challenging season, while
            another experiencing their best season. We showed up for each other. We honored each other for more than what occurred on the track. It was the shared goals and shared vision that unified us. And we all contributed. We were a cohesive
            family.
            <br></br>
            Gopher Athletics and the University of Minnesota fulfilled the commitment to prepare me to meet the great challenges facing our state, our nation, and our world. The legacy is invaluable. Leaders have been produced through the men's track
            and field program. The program shaped each and every one of us and we are using that for good to contribute to the rest of the world.
            <br></br>
            The heart of sport is designed to unify, reflect, and celebrate others. That's exactly what we need more of in our society.
            <br></br>
            The university value of "if we can dream it, we can do it" was instilled in me to the core. I believe that reinstating men's track and field is something we CAN do, together.
            <br></br>
            UNITED ARE WE.
