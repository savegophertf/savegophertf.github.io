            This University, and more specifically our track team prices itself on diversity and being united as one. I have been on the team since 2016, I saw when we were two separate programs. The men’s track team was just another team using the
            same facilities as us. As we grew as one program in 2018, nothing truly has been better for our program. We have more heart, fight, and talent between us all. These men have become some of my best friends, forever friends. That’s
            somethings that’s being taken away from so many people, not just those who are currently here. My idol on the track team is actually on the men’s team. This teammate provides strength, insight, determination, and everything this program
            is built on. Please do not rip this program in half. We are a family, we stand, we fight, we compete day in and day out together. We can’t do that if half of us are gone.
