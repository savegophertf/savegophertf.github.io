        <h3>
            Dear President Paxson,
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am writing to express my anger at your decision to eliminate the most diverse sports team at
            Brown, and my extreme frustration at the sloppy manner in which you announced it. As a
            member of the Brown community since 1973, and a former member of the Track and Cross
            Country teams, I find your decision to be silly and the manner in which it was communicated to
            be unworthy of the institution, and of its President. It was said of Warren G. Harding that his
            speeches were like armies of words, marching across the page in search of meaning. That was
            my reaction to the story in the BAM and your apparent reasons for eliminating the program. I
            read it three times in an effort to understand the justification for cutting Track and Field and
            Cross Country, and unfortunately your reasoning is still not clear. Of all teams at Brown, Track
            and Field is uniquely diverse and inclusive, low-cost on a per-capita basis, successful at a
            regional and national level, and completely integrated with the women's team. In fact, as they
            will all tell you, they are one team.
            <br></br>
            Finally, I find it appalling that members of the team found out about the decision, apparently in
            the works for years, at the same time as the public. I hope all of those student athletes use
            their great talent to sprint for the door and find a school and a school president that treats
            them with respect. Please count me a former member of the Brown community.
            <br></br>

            International Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, and Senior Official Performing
