            The track and field team at Minnesota for me means family. I know that word gets thrown around a lot but I truly mean it. Coming from a different country and not knowing anyone I was going to be at school with, it was a leap of faith for
            me, but one that I’ve certainly never looked back on. Since the day I got to Minnesota I’ve felt nothing but admiration for the people around me. I just want the generation after me to have the same opportunity and experience that I had.
