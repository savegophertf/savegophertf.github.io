            The menâ€™s team has been very impactful for me. I transferred here worrying about how I would fit into a large team. I immediately was welcomed and made friends for life. I have been captain now for 3 years and have watched so many
            different transformations amongst the members of this team. Life changing transformations. Discontinuing this team would be a tragedy and put a halt to all these life changing moments that happen from being apart of such a historic team.
