            Minnesota Track is the reason I am such a hard worker. This program has taught me to not give up when things get tough. If the program is canceled I will have to move away from my friends and family. My entire support system will be taken
            away from me. Knowing that future men will not have the same opportunities to grow as a human being makes me sick. The U of M is an amazing place, but if the track program is no longer, this school is that much closer to mediocre.
