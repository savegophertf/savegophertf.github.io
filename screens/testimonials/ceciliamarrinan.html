            Choosing Brown was easy. The track team possessed a strong camaraderie and positive culture that was compelling. It was clear from the start that this team operated as one unit. I was eager to be a part of that family. I was blindsided
            about the cuts in an email from President Paxson. The news did not become real until my coach called for an emergency team zoom meeting. He was at a loss for words. Even through the shock and dismay, the team offered mutual support and a
            determination to fight this incomprehensible decision.
            <br></br>
            This decision effects the womenâ€™s team immeasurably. I would not have chosen Brown if this decision happened before I committed. You cannot rip a diverse and successful family apart and still expect excellence.
