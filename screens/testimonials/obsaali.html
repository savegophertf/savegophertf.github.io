            To me, the University of Minnesota Track and Field team means the world. Growing up, I never imagined continuing my education post high school bc that was not something that was ever prioritized in the environment that I had grown up in.
            Going to college or perusing education post high school was something foreign until I was presented with the opportunity to run for one of the best schools in the entire country. University of Minnesota Track and Field program gave me the
            tools I needed. It put me on even playing field with the peers around me. Taking away this program means taking away opportunities from kids like me who went to a high school that was underfunded. By taking this program away, you are
            keeping those underrepresented kids marginalized.
