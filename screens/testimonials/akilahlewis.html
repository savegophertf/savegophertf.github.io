            Track and field has always been apart of my life allowing me to represent my country and now the university of Minnesota. Before coming here I felt nervous but I was quickly assured that I was wanted. This assurance came from the help of
            the men’s team who provided that safe space for me to be myself and some of the best support I’ve ever received. Cutting this team would be a tragic mistake that will cause irreversible damage and will surely cause many women to
            reconsider their decisions to commit to a program that promised them so much. Especially as a black international student athlete being apart of a team without men take a large chunk away from the community we have built as minorities.
