            The University of Minnesota track & field program provided me so many wonderful opportunities during my five years as a Gopher, both on and off the track. It taught me more about dedication, passion, and hard work than I ever thought
            possible. I went to the U of M to run, and without the track program, I wouldn’t have attended the university. I would not have created friendships that go way beyond the track. Quite frankly, without Minnesota track and field, I would
            not be who I am today.

            I also have Cystic Fibrosis, and the U of M has a great CF center. After I chose Minnesota to run, I linked with a CF physician, who coincidentally, also used to be a competitive, professional runner. He helped me understand how running
            was adding years onto my life and how given my condition, was the best form of therapy I could do. Without Minnesota track and field, I don’t gain that insight and knowledge about how running was (and still is) adding more years to my
            life. It is worth repeating, without Minnesota track and field, I would not be who I am today. This program gave me so many great memories, and also helped add years onto my life. I am forever grateful.
