            "There is something so raw, so sincere, so profoundly meaningful about track and field as a sport: the way every athlete and team collectively tests the limits of what they are capable of. This raw, perfect ambition forms the essence of
            Brown track and field -- yet uncoincidentally, it also lies at the core of this principle of EXCELLENCE which has supposedly informed the university’s recent athletics initiative.
            <br></br>
            Track IS excellence -- and my male track teammates, from Ivy individual champions to NCAA qualifiers to determined walk-ons, embody this principle of excellence in a way that is fundamentally aligned with the Brown ethic of “discharg[ing]
            the office of life with usefulness and reputation.” Their ambition, compassion, and drive is an indispensable component of the Brown community. To cut the Brown men’s track team is to go against everything that I THOUGHT Brown stands for.
            This decision leaves me disheartened and confused about what it means to be a Brown student-athlete, as I now deeply question the principles of the institution which I represent."
