            When I think of the Minnesota Men’s Track & Fields team I see much more than a rubber oval in Minneapolis. I see my little boy (Chip), my wife (Bri), and my best friend four-legged friend (Goldy). I see the men that stood beside me when
            I said “I do,” and hear the sounds of my best friends singing the ‘Rouser’ that same night at our wedding reception. I think of the brotherhood, the loyalty, and the hard work that I share with my teammates, formed through thousands of
            workouts and hours in the locker-room.
            <br><br>
            This picture is a result of my opportunity to be a Gopher track athlete, because without it I don’t meet Bri (Gopher Gymnast & W Track 9’-13’), and we don’t have our precious little boy. Without it, I don’t receive a degree from an elite
            Big Ten school. I likely don’t leave North Dakota. I don’t expand my perceptions of the world beyond what I grew up knowing. I don’t get the opportunity to experience teaching in underserved Minneapolis & St. Paul schools before taking on
            a classroom of my own. I don’t get to bring these experiences and perspectives to hundreds of high school student athletes in an effort to make them the best possible version of themselves.
            <br><br>
            Without Minnesota Men’s Track this picture is very different, and frankly it’s not a picture I care to imagine. This picture is exactly where I am supposed to be, with exactly who I am supposed to be with, and this is a picture of
            Minnesota Men’s Track and Field.
