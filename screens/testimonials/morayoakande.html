            I am a black woman from a low-income background who grew up in farm country, Middle America. My first pair of new shoes was because of Brown Track and Field. My first ever non-white coach (after being a 4-sport athlete at two different
            high schools!) was because of Brown Track and Field. Without the this team, I would never have known I could even belong at Brown.
