            Minnesota track and field has been a part of my family for generations. To me, being a part of this group has meant being a part of a family that loves and supports one another. It is a group that strives for excellence and holds each
            other accountable. I have looked up to Golden Gopher track and field athletes ever since I was a little kid and they were great role models to look up to and draw inspiration from. To rip the program out of existence would not only take
            away opportunities for me and my teammates, but also those of future Golden Gophers for generations to come.
