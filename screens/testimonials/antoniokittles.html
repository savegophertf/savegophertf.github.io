            "Removing the T&F program threatens the foundation of Brown's principles of inclusion, diversity, progress and overall excellence.
            <br></br>
            Brown provided an OPPORTUNITY to receive a first-class education along with the ability to make the most out of oneâ€™s athletic career.
            <br></br>
            Brown demonstrated that INCLUSION is the greatest learning tool. Division 1 program participants were diverse in skill and talent, which made for a well-rounded team. The program supported the development of its students as athletes,
            thinkers, collaborators and leaders. Every single teammate had something to give and they gave it their all.
            <br></br>
            Brown Track and Field was PROGRESSIVE in its investment in excellence. Understanding that circumstances were different for all, the support systems was designed to aid with the challenges that arose. Without understanding to address the
            diversity of its student-athlete body, there would be no opportunities and inclusion.
            <br></br>
            While we did not garner a championship as a team, the program offers an Ivy League champion in almost every discipline of the sport, contenders across the IC4As, All Americans, and professional athletes. Most importantly, we have
            CHAMPIONS in every non-sport professional field who uphold the tradition of Excellence rooted by their program experience."
