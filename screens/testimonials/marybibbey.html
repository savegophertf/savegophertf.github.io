            XC / Track & Field is the one sport that unites athletes whose specialities don’t look at all the same. This sport brings to life a family made up of every income level, gender, and race. We train, we learn, we grow, side by side. By
            taking away our Men’s team, you are taking away our training partners. Together we reach new heights, new speeds, new distances. We are not simply disappointed by this decision, we are hurting because our whole world has been uprooted.
            This family has been torn apart.
