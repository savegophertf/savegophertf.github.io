            I was recruited as a walk on by Coach Roy Griak in 1975, and a member of CC/Track 1975-77.
            I am a President's Club Donor with Endowed Scholarship in Men's CC/Track and another in Carlson Business School. Coach Griak and I stayed friends until his passing and we deeply cared for each other. I credit my time at Minnesota as a
            student
            athlete for much of my personal and professional success.

            The Athletics Department is eliminating far too many opportunities
            for Minnesotans to be student athletes at the University - this is in conflict with the Mission to give opportunities and education to Minnesotans. Track has the second highest participation levels in all Minnesota HS sports - where do
            the best now go for
            opportunity at the collegiate level? Track athletes consistently perform well in the classroom (17 Academic National Awards in Spring '20) and on the track. Mens Track and Field is the most diverse team at Minnesota. Minnesota is the
            first Power 5 school to drop track in 17 years. Eliminating TF essentially
            kills CC. I recommend Athletics look at last 5 years of participation numbers in Men's and Women's sports at U of MN. Significant money moved from non revenue sports for other spending.
