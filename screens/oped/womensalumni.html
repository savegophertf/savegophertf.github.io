        <h3>
            Excellence and Equity in Men’s Track
        </h3>
        <p>
            As alumnae of the Brown Women’s Cross Country and Track &amp; Field team, we
            are writing in solidarity with current teammates on the Brown Men’s Cross Country and
            Track &amp; Field team whose collegiate athletic careers were abruptly terminated in a
            school-wide email this week. The email from President Christina Paxson, Director of
            Athletics Jack Hayes and the “Committee on Excellence in Athletics” came as a surprise
            to the 112* members of the Track &amp; Field team and their coaches. The University cut the
            Men’s Cross Country and Track &amp; Field team along with eight other varsity teams by
            announcing a “cease [to] training, competition and operations at the varsity level”,
            effective immediately. The announcement touted the decision under the guise of
            excellence, competitiveness and maintaining Title IX balance between Brown’s male and
            female athletes. This action is a poor excuse for an equity and excellence initiative as it
            removes one of the most diverse men’s teams on campus and dramatically weakens the
            largest women’s team at Brown. The initiative states that Brown demonstrates their
            compliance with Title IX “by ensuring that the proportion of varsity athletics opportunities
            offered to women corresponds with the percentage of Brown undergraduate students
            who are women, and likewise for men — a concept called substantial proportionality”.
            Cutting half of the Brown Track &amp; Field program clearly indicates that Brown’s
            commitment to Title IX is based on a narrow understanding of equity, as the ratio
            between male and female athletes, that undermines the quality of the women’s team and
            the true vision of Title IX. 
            <br></br>
            The decision by the Committee on Excellence in Athletics to cut this team
            contradicts their stated goals of “advancing excellence and equity”. Regarding the goal
            of “advancing excellence”, 20% of 2020 Brown Athletics award winners were on the
            men’s track team. That’s 20% from a single one of Brown’s thirty-eight varsity teams.
            The team has produced numerous Academic All-Ivy and Academic All-Americans,
            including in 2019 when the men’s cross country team as a whole was named Academic
            All-American. Athletically, in the past six years the men’s team has produced 15 school
            records, 110 top-10 program marks, and 17 individual Conference Champions bolstered
            by 90 top three individual Conference finishes. They have had 6 NCAA All-Americans
            and produced two Olympians in the past 8 years: Evan Weinstock ‘14 and Craig Kinsley
            ‘11. If that’s not excellence, what is?
            <br></br>
            The committee’s assumption that cutting the men’s team will not have dramatic
            ramifications for the women’s team reveals their limited understanding of the Brown
            Track &amp; Field program. The majority of track and field athletes train in mixed-gender
            squads with men and women sharing coaches, equipment, and training plans -- i.e.,
            sharing the precious resources that this initiative claims to save. Without a men’s team
            our women’s team will lose valuable training partners who push us to be better every
            day. We will lose funding as many alumni stop donating to an athletic department that
            has shown it does not have the best interest of their team at heart. We will lose
            competitiveness as athletes choose to attend schools with co-ed teams and more
            institutional support. We will lose out on coaching opportunities as experienced coaches
            leave, or pass on, jobs at Brown in favor of schools with co-ed teams. Brown has already
            said it will cut two of our coaches - when each coach is so specialized, this will leave
            some women entirely without guidance. A sprints coach cannot teach shot put
            technique;a distance coach cannot show a long-jumper proper extension. Cutting the
            men’s team also eliminates the possibility of hosting track meets at Brown, as co-ed
            teams will decline to travel to women-only meets and will seek out opportunities for
            competition elsewhere. We do not want these remarkable female athletes to (rightfully)
            feel that the University preserved the women’s program merely to bolster Title IX roster
            requirements and free up more recruiting spots for men. Cutting half our team calls into
            question our ability to rely on sustained institutional support for athletes, coaches, and
            staff.
            <br></br>
             By reducing coaching staff, eliminating our support system and training partners
            in the men’s team, and diminishing the prestige of Brown Track &amp; Field, this decision
            effectively cuts the women’s program. Brown claims that this initiative will enable
            surviving teams to thrive, yet the effects on the women’s program -- a program that has
            produced two All-Americans in the last two years and three individual Ivy League
            champions in the last championship alone-- were an afterthought. We aren’t two teams,
            we’re one family. Where one team goes, the other follows; cutting the men’s team marks
            the beginning of the end for the women’s team as well. 
            <br></br>
            Ultimately, though the University complies with their gender ratio commitments
            under Title IX, the decision to cut the men’s track team will diminish the prestige of the
            current and future women’s track team while also impacting the diversity the track team
            brings to the school. Adhering to Title IX should not simply be an issue of compliance, it
            should be part of a broader institutional commitment to uphold the principles of integrity,
            inclusion, and equity. If the committee would like to ensure “diversity and inclusion,”
            cutting the men’s  team is not the way to do it.. The track team has more minority
            representation and socio-economic diversity than the Brown student body as a whole -
            according to Brown’s 2018 Diversity Dashboard,10.8% of University students were
            Black/African American compared to 16% Black/African American athletes on the 2019-
            2020 men’s track roster. Brown Track &amp; Field is one of the only co-ed sports that
            provides lower financial barriers to entry and equal opportunity to individuals from all
            socio-economic and racial backgrounds. As a percentage, Brown men’s track &amp; field
            follows only basketball (32%) and football (23%) in numbers of black/African-American
            male students on the team, and in terms of absolute numbers, track has the highest
            number of black/African-American male athletes after football. Additionally, in stark
            contrast to these other teams Track has the lowest per-participant operating budget.
            Many members of the women’s team recall that it was on the track team where they first
            met someone who was like them: someone whose parents also hadn’t gone to college
            or didn’t work a white collar job;someone who also understood the stress of student
            loans and financial aid. Some said that it was the only place they felt understood at
            Brown.
            <br></br> 
            Above all of our concerns, we are heartbroken. We are heartbroken for our coaches who
            have dedicated countless hours to shaping the individuals on this team as athletes and
            people. They were neither consulted nor included at any point in this process and were
            only notified of the decision within an hour of the public announcement. They are now
            forced to look for jobs in the middle of a pandemic. We are heartbroken for alumni,
            particularly the class of 2020, who lost their graduation and their entire spring season
            due to the COVID-19 pandemic,and who are now unwittingly the last in a long line of
            track and field athletes, dating back to the first varsity team at Brown in 1878. And we
            are heartbroken for the current men’s team athletes whose collegiate athletic careers
            were unceremoniously cut short. Although the committee claims that this decision
            “provides our current and newly recruited athletes the most flexibility to consider their
            options,” this is simply not true. We have been told by current athletes that a meeting
            held by the university callously offered them options for transferring and little by way of
            options to support those who wanted to remain at Brown. To add insult to injury, the
            window for transferring schools in time for the fall season has passed and opportunities
            at different schools for financial aid and other scholarships are uncertain - often
            completely unavailable. The decision to leave Brown -- and all of the opportunities that
            an Ivy League education provides -- is not one many athletes will make; they will
            exchange their athletic dreams for practicality, resenting the very school they once
            proudly represented. The suggestion that our track and field team can be served by club
            running is a slap in the face. Club runners cannot compete in the NCAA and have no
            place for jumpers, hurdlers, shot putters, and the many other non-distance runners who
            make up the majority of our team. According to the committee,  “The initiative will also
            align more broadly with the University’s diversity and inclusion efforts, expanding
            opportunities for non-recruited athletes to participate in competitive club sports and
            enhancing diversity on teams, which already attract a diverse array of student-athletes.”
            The jumps, sprints, and throws event-groups are consistently the most diverse event-
            groups on the team, and include many walk-ons. The university’s suggestion of a
            “running club” as an alternative eliminates the most diverse cohort of track &amp; field
            athletes and demonstrates the committee’s limited knowledge of the program and
            blatant disregard for diversity. 
            <br></br>
            Our teammates are currently faced with the terrible decision to choose between
            the sport they love and the school they love. This impossible choice could have been
            prevented if the University had involved the people most affected in the decision-making
            process. It still is preventable. The Brown Women’s Track &amp; Field Alumnae demand
            more transparency from the Athletic Department and President Christina Paxson on its
            justification of this decision through Title IX. We demand an acknowledgement of the
            negative effects this decision has on the inclusion of women and students of diverse
            backgrounds. We demand the administration reinstate the Brown Men’s Cross Country
            and Track and Field Team, effective immediately.
            <br></br>
            The press release on the Excellence in Brown Athletics Initiative notes that:
            “Director of Brown Athletics Jack Hayes said that for both varsity and club sports, Brown
            recognizes the power of competitive athletics to bring together students, staff, faculty,
            parents and alumni to build pride, affinity and a strong sense of community.”Jack Hayes,
            you were correct - sport builds community, and now we’ve rallied ours to defend its
            legacy.
